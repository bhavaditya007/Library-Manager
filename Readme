Library Manager

A web-based personal library management system that allows users to catalog books, store their physical locations, and manage their collection through a clean and intuitive interface. The application supports both manual book entry and image-based metadata extraction with ISBN lookup via Google Books API.

Live Demo:

Features

- Add books with title, author, genre, and physical location
- Mandatory location tracking (shelf, room, etc.)
- Search books by title
- Sort library alphabetically by title
- Remove books from the collection
- Upload book images for metadata extraction
- ISBN detection using Google Books API
- Clean, minimal, user-friendly UI
- Deployed on Railway (cloud hosted)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Jinja2 (Flask templates)

Backend
- Python
- Flask

Database
- SQLite

APIs & Libraries
- Google Books API
- pytesseract (OCR fallback)
- Requests

Deployment
- Railway (Free Tier)
- GitHub (CI/CD integration)

How It Works

1. User adds a book manually or uploads an image of the book.
2. If an image is uploaded:
   - ISBN is detected from extracted text
   - Book metadata is fetched using Google Books API
3. User confirms details and provides the book’s physical location.
4. Book is stored in the database and displayed in the library view.
5. Users can search, sort, or remove books at any time.

Run Locally

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/library-manager.git
cd library-manager


Create and activate virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app:
python app.py

Open in browser:
http://localhost:8080

Deployment

The application is deployed on **Railway** with automatic redeployments on every GitHub push.

* Uses dynamic port binding via `PORT` environment variable
* Runs continuously on Railway servers
* Free tier may sleep during inactivity (expected behavior)

Limitations

* SQLite database may reset on full redeploys (free-tier limitation)
* OCR accuracy depends on image quality
* Advanced OpenCV-based OCR not used for cloud compatibility

Future Improvements

* Persistent PostgreSQL database
* User authentication
* Book cover previews
* Cloud-based OCR (Google Vision / AWS Textract)
* Mobile-friendly PWA support
* Export library as CSV or PDF
